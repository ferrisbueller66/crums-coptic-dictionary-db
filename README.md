# crums-coptic-dictionary-db

This React app utilizes Redux and allows users to journal the flavor profiles and tasting of different whiskeys. Data can persisted with a Ruby on Rails backend and SQLite3 database.

Usage
To use SoodSoure, download a zipped file from Github (https://github.com/tmtarpinian/bourbon_journal_frontend).

Please have ruby, rails, node.js, and react installed prior to running this application.

After unzipping and saving the contents to the desired directory, and run 'npm install' to install all the packages required for this program.

From within that directory, run 'npm' in your terminal, then open 'localhost:3000' (or the listening port stated in your terminal) in a web browser.

Your default web browser should open or a prompt to open a web browser should allow you to then see the app. If not, open the index.html file in a web browser.

The close the program, exit your web browser and type 'contrl/command + C' in your terminal to exit react server.

If you would like to persist your data, download the backend counterpart to this app at (https://github.com/tmtarpinian/bourbon_journal_backend).

Upon download, unzip the contents to the desired directory, and run 'bundle install' to install all the gems required for the rails backend.

From within that directory, run 'rails s' in your terminal, then open 'localhost:3001' The react app running on localhost:3000 should now be able send get and post requests to the back end and persist data.

## Formatting Decisions and Rationale
Since digitizing this project no longer constrains us to fit within the limits of a physical page, it allows the opportunity to reduce abbreviations, hopefully mitigating confusion arising from more obscure abbreviations as well as making data more searcheable.

I did not want to take liberties with Crum's work, and worked to maintain his formatting as much as possible.

1. I did update biblical refererences to conform to SBL style standards
2. I kept the source abbreviations the same as Crum
